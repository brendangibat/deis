Deis Roadmap
============
The Deis Roadmap is a community document created as part of the open :ref:`planning`.
Each roadmap item describes a high-level capability or grouping of features that are deemed
important to the future of Deis.

Given the project's rapid :ref:`Release Schedule, <release_schedule>` roadmap items are designed to provide a sense of
direction over many releases.

TTY Broker
----------
Today Deis cannot provide bi-directional streams needed for log tailing and interactive batch processes.
By having the :ref:`Controller` drive a TTY Broker component, Deis can securely open WebSockets
through the routing mesh.

 - [ ] `TTY Broker component`_
 - [ ] `Interactive Deis Run`_ (``deis run bash``)
 - [ ] `Log Tailing`_ (``deis logs -f``)

Scheduling and Orchestration
----------------------------
Today Deis uses :ref:`Fleet <fleet_scheduler>` for scheduling.  Unfortunately, Fleet does not
support resource-based scheduling, which results in poor cluster utilization at scale.

Fortunately, Deis is composable and can easily hot-swap orchestration APIs.
Because the most promising container orchestration solutions are under heavy development,
the Deis project is focused on releasing "technology previews".

These technology previews help the community try different orchestration solutions easily,
report their findings and guide the future direction of Deis. :ref:`Kubernetes <k8s_scheduler>`,
:ref:`Mesos with Marathon <mesos_scheduler>`, and :ref:`Swarm <swarm_scheduler>` will all be
available for testing in Deis v1.9.

 - [X] :ref:`Swarm preview <swarm_scheduler>`
 - [X] :ref:`Mesos preview <mesos_scheduler>`
 - [X] :ref:`Kubernetes preview <k8s_scheduler>`

Etcd 2
------
A CP database like etcd is central to Deis, which requires a distributed lock service and key/value store.
As problems with etcd directly impact platform stability, Deis must move to the more stable etcd2.

 - [X] Switch to etcd2
 - [X] Migration strategy for etcd 0.4.x -> etcd2

This feature is tracked as GitHub issue `#3564`_.

Monitoring & Telemetry
----------------------
Deis installations today use custom solutions for monitoring, alerting and operational visibility.
Deis will standardize the monitoring interfaces and provide open source agent(s) that can be used to ship telemetry to arbitrary endpoints.

 - [ ] Host Telemetry (cpu, memory, network, disk)
 - [ ] Container Telemetry (cpu, memory, network, disk)
 - [ ] Platform Telemetry (control plane, data plane)
 - [ ] Controller Telemetry (app created, build created, containers scaled)

This feature is tracked as GitHub issue `#3699`_.

Production Hardening
--------------------

For users running Deis in large environments, support is lacking for things like separating the
control plane and data plane (application and routing mesh), running etcd on only a fraction
of the hosts, and other architectural design customizations. Specifically, work is in
progress for:

 - [ ] Better support for large-scale clusters (`#3635`_)
 - [ ] Support for separating the data plane and control plane (`#3023`_)

Stateless Logger
----------------
Users who have elected to run a Ceph-less cluster give up application logs since
``deis-controller`` has nowhere to store them. To alleviate this, we plan to implement an in-memory ring buffer
for the ``deis-logger`` component, so that a reasonable period of recent logs is stored and can be queried with
``deis logs``.

This feature is tracked as GitHub issue `#4000`_.

Update Service
--------------
Deis must support 100% automated, zero-downtime updates of the control plane.
Like CoreOS, Deis clusters should be attached to an alpha, beta or stable channel and rely on an automatic update mechanism.
To accomplish this, Deis plans to use the `Google Omaha Protocol`_ as implemented by `CoreUpdate`_.

 - [ ] `Update client/agent`_
 - [ ] Update server
 - [ ] `Automatic CoreOS upgrades`_
 - [ ] CI Integration

This feature is tracked as GitHub issue `#2106`_.

Deis Push
---------
End-users should be able to push Docker-based applications into Deis from their local machine using ``deis push user/app``.
This works around a number of authentication issues with private registries and ``deis pull``.

 - [ ] `Docker Registry v2`_
 - [ ] `Deis Push`_

Networking v2
-------------
To provide a better container networking experience, Deis must provide an overlay network
that can facilitate SDN and improved service discovery.

 - [X] Overlay Network (flannel)
 - [ ] `Internal Service Discovery`_
 - [ ] Migration Strategy

This feature is tracked as GitHub issue `#3812`_.

Service Broker
--------------
In Deis, connections to :ref:`concepts_backing_services` are meant to be explicit and modeled as a series of environment variables.
Deis believes the Cloud Foundry `Service Broker API`_ is the best embodiment of this today.

 - [ ] Deis Addons CLI (deis addons)
 - [ ] PostgreSQL Service Broker
 - [ ] Redis Service Broker

This feature is tracked as GitHub issue `#231`_.
